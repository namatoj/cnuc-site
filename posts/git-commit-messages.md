OK, so I read three articles/blog posts about good commit messages. I did this so you don’t have to. The best one of then was [this one by Jacob Herrington](https://dev.to/jacobherrington/how-to-write-useful-commit-messages-my-commit-message-template-20n9).

- The first line of the commit message is the subject line.
  - Start with a capital letter.
  - Use no more than 50 letters.
  - Don’t end with a period.
  - This should be a good summary of the change.
  - Write in imperative mood: Fix, not Fixes or Fixed.
- The second line should always be empty.
- The body of the commit message should focus on why the change was made. (Unless it is a minor obvious change)
- Then write what was done. Give context. This is the part that the subject line of the commit message is summarizing.

Happy committing.
